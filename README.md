R2D2 Dynamic Digital Phantom is designed to mimic realistic perfusion and contrast agent delivery in rat kidney. It can be used as inputs and group-truth for validation and evaluation of imaging techniques, especially perfusion-based or contrast-enhanced modalities. Readers are encouraged to refer to the associated paper for details on methods constructing the phantom.
